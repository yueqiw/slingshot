Package: slingshot
Title: Tools for ordering single-cell sequencing
Version: 0.99.8
Description: Provides functions for inferring continuous, branching 
    lineage structures in low-dimensional data. Slingshot was designed
    to model developmental trajectories in single-cell RNA sequencing 
    data and serve as a component in an analysis pipeline after 
    dimensionality reduction and clustering. It is flexible enough to 
    handle arbitrarily many branching events and allows for the 
    incorporation of prior knowledge through supervised graph 
    construction.
